    <h2>About Paradox AntiCheat</h2>
  </div>
  <p>Paradox AntiCheat is a powerful tool designed to combat cheating in Minecraft Bedrock worlds. The name "Paradox" was chosen because the concept of paradox perfectly represents the essence of what we do.</p>
  <p>Paradox AntiCheat is a statement that contradicts itself. It is a tool that fights cheating by using advanced algorithms and techniques that are themselves paradoxical in nature.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Paradox: A statement or situation that contradicts itself, opposed to common sense and yet perhaps true.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Paradox AntiCheat offers a comprehensive solution for detecting and preventing cheating in Minecraft Bedrock. It uses detection methods to ensure that cheaters are caught and punished. In addition, Paradox AntiCheat is highly customizable, allowing game developers to tailor the tool to their specific needs and requirements.</p>
  <p>If you're looking for a reliable and effective anti-cheat solution for your Minecraft Bedrock experience, look no further than Paradox AntiCheat. For more information, check out the <a href="https://pete9xi.github.io/Paradox_AntiCheat/#/">Documentation</a>.</p>

## Applying the Paradox AntiCheat Pack

When applying the pack to your world, make sure the addon is at the top of the behavior pack list and Beta APIs is enabled. This is to ensure all checks and systems work properly. The versioning system for Paradox goes as follows:

- The first number denotes the pack version. This will rarely change unless there have been major changes to the code.
- The second number denotes the major revision of the pack version. These particular changes mostly involve features being added or removed.
- The third number indicates the minor revision of the Pack. This evolves around bug fixes.

## Installing the Paradox AntiCheat Pack

To install this anticheat to your realm/world, follow these steps:

1. Install the `.mcpack`.
2. Apply it to your world.
3. Enable Beta APIs.

Once you have done this, the anticheat should be fully up and running.
